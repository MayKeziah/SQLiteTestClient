# ABOUT
'''
A list of variables relating to a SQLite3 database. 

This file is designed to be accompanied by a testing program (testClient.py) 
that uses the variables contained in this file (globals.py) to run a series 
of tests on SQLite files. 

This program is written in python 3.8.3 and is written to accompany an interface 
(testClient.py) for sqlite3.

INSTALLATION: Change all the global variables to match your database's file organization. 
Place testClient.py and globals.py in the locations of your choosing and update the 
import statement for globals.py in testClient.py to match. 
Then, run testClient.py. To control what testClient.py does on run, consult the README.md
in this repository (github.com/MayKeziah/SQLiteTestClient).
