# ABOUT
'''
A simple class for automated testing and reporting on a sqlite database. 

This file is designed to be accompanied by a list of global variables (globals.py) 
that tell this file where to find the database and its files for 
creation, insertion, selection, etc. 

This program is written in python 3.8.3 and is written to interface with sqlite3.

INSTALLATION: Find the associated globals.py file and change all the global variables 
to match your database's file organization. Place testMaster.py globals.py 
in the locations of your choosing and update the import statement for globals.py in this file. 
Then, run this file (testMaster.py).
